# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Load this project. I have an issue to fix. It supports Excel exports, score entries, and score edits. They all work fine but there is a scenario I want to support. Current system averages incorrectly due to '0's for skipped matches. Excel export needs to display '0's as '-'. Data entry UI must support nulls for score and Xes. Goal: Implement NULL for skipped matches instead of 0."

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the NULL handling for skipped matches. Created test data with a mix of NULL values and 0 values across different match types and calibers. Verified that NULL scores are correctly displayed as '-' in the Excel export and excluded from average calculations, while scores of 0 are properly included in the calculations. The shooter statistics endpoint correctly handles NULL scores in all average calculations. All tests passed successfully."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Performed additional testing of the Excel export functionality. Verified that: 1) NULL scores are correctly displayed as '-' in both individual tabs and the Match Report tab, 2) NULL scores are properly excluded from average calculations, 3) Scores of 0 are correctly displayed as '0' and included in calculations, 4) Aggregated totals correctly exclude NULL scores but include 0 scores. The total row in individual detail sheets correctly shows '-' for NULL scores and includes 0 scores in the sum. All requirements for NULL handling in Excel exports have been met."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Executed comprehensive NULL handling tests to verify all requirements. Created test match with multiple stages and test shooter. Created scores with: 1) All stage scores as NULL (resulting in NULL total score), 2) Some stages as NULL and others with values (total includes only non-NULL stages), 3) Stages with values but NULL x_count values (resulting in NULL total x_count), 4) Scores with 0 values (treated as valid scores). Verified Excel export displays NULL scores as '-' in both individual sheets and Match Report summary. Confirmed average calculations correctly exclude NULL scores while including 0 scores. All tests passed successfully, confirming proper NULL handling throughout the application."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Executed additional tests for the Excel export functionality with the not_shot flag approach. Created test scores with various combinations of regular scores, 0 scores, and NULL scores (marked as not_shot). Verified that: 1) Scores marked as not_shot display 'Not Shot' in red in individual sheets and '-' in total rows, 2) not_shot scores display as '-' in the Match Report summary tab, 3) not_shot scores are excluded from average calculations in Column B, 4) 0 scores are correctly displayed as '0' and included in averages, 5) Match subtype labels are properly aligned with data tables. All tests passed successfully, confirming that the simplified not_shot flag approach cleanly handles skipped matches without affecting average calculations."
