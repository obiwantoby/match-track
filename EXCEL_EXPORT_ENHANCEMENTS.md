# Excel Export Enhancements

## Overview

The Excel export feature has been enhanced to improve data analysis and readability by adding:
1. A new average score column next to the shooter name
2. Freeze panes functionality to keep the shooter name and average columns visible when scrolling horizontally

## Implementation Details

### 1. Average Score Column

A new "Average" column has been added that:
- Appears immediately after the shooter name column
- Calculates the mean of all valid scores for that shooter
- Displays the average with 2 decimal places
- Properly handles cases with no valid scores

```python
# Calculate average (if there are any valid scores)
if valid_scores:
    average_score = sum(valid_scores) / len(valid_scores)
    row.append(f"{average_score:.2f}")
else:
    row.append("-")
```

### 2. Freeze Panes

Freeze panes functionality has been implemented to improve usability when viewing many match columns:
- Freezes the first two columns (Shooter Name and Average)
- Keeps these columns visible when scrolling horizontally
- Maintains the header row visibility

```python
# Freeze panes to keep the shooter name and average columns visible when scrolling
ws.freeze_panes = ws.cell(row=9, column=3)  # Freeze first two columns (A and B)
```

### 3. Modified Column Formatting

Column widths and alignments have been adjusted to accommodate the new average column:
- Shooter name column: 20 characters wide
- Average column: 15 characters wide
- All score columns: 15 characters wide
- Center alignment for all numeric columns (average and scores)

```python
# Auto-adjust column widths for headers
for i, column_width in enumerate([20, 15] + [15] * (len(header_row) - 2), 1):
    ws.column_dimensions[get_column_letter(i)].width = column_width
```

## Benefits

### For Data Analysis

1. **Quick Statistical Insight**: The average column provides immediate insight into a shooter's overall performance
2. **Consistent Reference**: As users scroll through multiple match columns, they can always see the shooter name and average
3. **Performance Comparison**: Easily compare shooters' average scores without needing to calculate them manually

### For Usability

1. **Improved Navigation**: Freeze panes makes it easier to navigate horizontally through many columns
2. **Context Preservation**: Always know which shooter's data you're viewing, even when scrolled far right
3. **Professional Formatting**: Enhanced Excel functionality makes the report look and function more professionally

## Updated Excel Report Structure

### Summary Sheet Layout:
```
| Shooter Name | Average | Match 1 Score | Match 2 Score | ... | Aggregate |
|--------------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| John Doe     | 94.75   | 95 (5X)       | 96 (4X)       | ... | 191 (9X)  |
| Jane Smith   | 97.50   | 98 (7X)       | 97 (6X)       | ... | 195 (13X) |
```

The first two columns (Shooter Name and Average) remain visible when scrolling horizontally through many match columns.

## Technical Implementation

1. Added "Average" to the header row
2. Modified the column width calculations
3. Created a separate collection mechanism for scores
4. Implemented the average calculation logic
5. Applied freeze panes at cell C9 (row 9, column 3)
6. Updated cell alignment settings for the new column

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing data formats and Excel templates.
